# KeepOnRoad
Application to monitor if driver is alert.

The system has a camera mounted on the rearview mirror that checks the alertness of the driver using image processing algorithms and 
if the driver is not being alert or is sleepy an alarm is sounded, warning him to stay alert or simply as a gently reminder.
The warning messages are displayed in the rearview mirror. <br/><br/>
